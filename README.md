Welcome to My Portfolio – Pruthviraj Pawar, Web Developer

Hello! I’m Pruthviraj Pawar, and this is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my skills, passion, and the projects I’ve worked on. I’m a web developer with a love for creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites. This site is the place where you can explore what I do, learn about my journey as a developer, and check out some of the projects I’ve worked on.

Simple and User-Friendly Design

The design of my portfolio is minimalist, clean, and intuitive. When you land on the homepage, you’ll be greeted by my name, "Pruthviraj Pawar," and my profession, “Web Developer.” The goal is to immediately communicate who I am and what I do. The navigation is simple with sections for Home, About, Projects, and Contact. Each section is easily accessible, and everything is structured in a way that ensures a smooth browsing experience.

To make the website mobile-friendly, I’ve included a hamburger-style menu that adjusts for smaller screens, ensuring that it looks great on all devices. The clean layout reflects my approach to web development—focused on simplicity, functionality, and user experience.

I’ve always been passionate about technology and design, and web development is where I can bring both of those interests together.
